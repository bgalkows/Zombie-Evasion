# Zombie Evasion

Zombie Evasion is a dynamic and gripping survival game based
around avoiding and evading an ever-increasing horder of zombies.
The objective is to survive long enough to evacuate via a helicopter
called in to your initial location.  Surrounding terrain is designed
to be mazelike yet still diverse enough to provide strategic options.

I developed Zombie Evasion completely on my own in the summer of 2017
while attempting to expand my technological repertoire.  For the first
time, I dabbled with artificially intelligent agents and 3D modeling.
Overall, Zombie Evasion was a fun experiment which helped direct my 
personal career trajectory from that point forward.
